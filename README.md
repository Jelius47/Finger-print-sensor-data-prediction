# Machine Learning Project: Predictive Model with Random Forest Classifier

## Overview

This project demonstrates the process of data manipulation, feature engineering, data visualization, and building a predictive machine learning model using a **Random Forest Classifier**. The main goal of the project is to build a robust machine learning pipeline that includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation, ultimately achieving high accuracy on predictions.

## Project Description

In this project, we perform the following key steps:

1. **Data Manipulation**: Importing and cleaning the data to prepare it for analysis. This includes handling missing values, feature selection, and feature transformation.
   
2. **Feature Manipulation**: Engineering new features based on the raw data to enhance the predictive power of the model.

3. **Visualization**: Creating various visualizations to understand the dataset better. These include:
   - **Heatmaps**: To identify correlations between features.
   - **Word Clouds**: To visualize text-based data or feature importance.
   - **Histograms**: To understand the distribution of numerical features.

4. **Model Building**: Using the **Random Forest Classifier** to train and test the model for predicting the target variable. The model is evaluated based on its performance, and the final trained model is saved for future use.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for the project.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For visualizations (e.g., heatmaps, histograms).
- **WordCloud**: For generating word clouds from textual data.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
- **Pickle/Joblib**: For saving the trained model as a `.pkl` file for future use.

## Data Manipulation

### Steps Involved:
- **Data Loading**: Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
- **Data Cleaning**: Remove or impute missing values.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create new features from existing ones to improve model performance.
- **Feature Scaling**: Standardize/normalize numerical features for better model performance.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the data
data = pd.read_csv('dataset.csv')

# Check for missing values
data.isnull().sum()

# Impute or remove missing values
data.fillna(method='ffill', inplace=True)

Data Visualization
Visualization is a critical step to understand the data better. In this project, we use the following charts:

Heatmap:

Helps to identify correlations between different features of the dataset.
Always show details

import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate heatmap to visualize correlations
corr_matrix = data.corr()
sns.heatmap(corr_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
plt.show()
Word Cloud:

Helps visualize the most frequent terms in text-based datasets.
Always show details

from wordcloud import WordCloud

# Generate word cloud
wordcloud = WordCloud(width=800, height=400).generate_from_frequencies(word_frequencies)
plt.imshow(wordcloud, interpolation='bilinear')
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()
Histogram:

Used to visualize the distribution of numerical features.
Always show details

# Plot histogram
data['feature_column'].hist(bins=20)
plt.title('Feature Distribution')
plt.show()
Model Building: Random Forest Classifier
Steps Involved:
Splitting the Data: Divide the dataset into features (X) and target (y), and then split it into training and testing sets.

Always show details

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X = data.drop('target_column', axis=1)
y = data['target_column']

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
Training the Model: We train the Random Forest Classifier on the training data.

Always show details

from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

rf_model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
rf_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
Model Evaluation: After training the model, we evaluate its performance using metrics like accuracy.

Always show details

from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

y_pred = rf_model.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Model Accuracy: {accuracy}')
Saving the Model: The trained model is saved for future use as a .pkl file.

Always show details

import pickle

# Save the trained model
with open('random_forest_model.pkl', 'wb') as f:
    pickle.dump(rf_model, f)
How to Run the Project
Prerequisites:
Install required dependencies:

Always show details

pip install -r requirements.txt
or install them manually:

Always show details

pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn wordcloud
Download the dataset and place it in the same directory as the script (or update the file path in the script).

Run the script:

Always show details

python train_model.py
Additional Notes:
Make sure the dataset is properly cleaned before running the model.
You can tweak the hyperparameters of the RandomForestClassifier to improve the modelâ€™s performance.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to preprocess data, perform feature manipulation, visualize the dataset, and build a predictive model using the Random Forest Classifier. The model is saved for future predictions, ensuring its usability beyond just training.
